        <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
          but only 36% plan to spend a vacation in their home country. Like, what haven't we seen here at home?
          In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau.
          And you can also see all these beauties without millions on your account, a foreign passport and many hours of flights.
          Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova-a brave young mother who took three children in her arms, sat them in her "Lada" and
          I drove 20 thousand kilometers in my native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.

              First of all, because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.

              a variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains.
              And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.</p>
